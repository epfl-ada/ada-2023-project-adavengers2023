During this project we will use the CMU Movie Summary Corpus available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/. 

The analysis we will run focus on gender representation in movies. To do so we have one main approach which focus on analyzing the difference in vocabulary using to describe women and men in movies summaries. Then we will run further analysis on the evolution of the representation of women in movies over time. 

## Vocabulary use for men and women
The question we will try to answer in this part is what adjectives are used to describe men and women in summaries of movies and their differences. 

## Evolution of the representation of women over time

Does the frequency with which women appear as protagonists change over time? 

## Abstract

Our project aims to critically examine the portrayal of female characters in cinema. Driven by the moviesâ€˜ profound cognitive influence, our objective is to explore how depictions of women evolve with time and to identify any existing biases or subtle forms of discrimination.

To achieve this, we will investigate the differences in commonly used adjectives that appear alongside male or female characters in movie summaries. We will also study the characteristics of female characters across different movie genres, tracing how their portrayals have transformed in line with the rising tide of the feminist movement. Furthermore, our research includes an analysis of the impact of female characters on box office performance, incorporating additional datasets for a more comprehensive understanding.

This study is fueled by the increasing societal focus on gender representation in media. By scrutinizing historical and character-level data, we aim to reveal trends in the depiction of women in film, thereby mirroring broader societal shifts.
