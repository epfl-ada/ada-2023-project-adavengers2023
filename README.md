During this project we will use the CMU Movie Summary Corpus available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/. 

The analysis we will run focus on gender representation in movies. To do so we have one main approach which focus on analyzing the difference in vocabulary using to describe women and men in movies summaries. Then we will run further analysis on the evolution of the representation of women in movies over time. 

## Vocabulary use for men and women
The question we will try to answer in this part is what adjectives are used to describe men and women in summaries of movies and their differences. 

## Evolution of the representation of women over time

Does the frequency with which women appear as protagonists change over time?
